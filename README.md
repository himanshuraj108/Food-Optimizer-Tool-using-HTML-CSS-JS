# RouteOptima - Advanced Food Delivery Path Optimization

**RouteOptima** is an interactive, visually rich web application designed to help food delivery and logistics services optimize routes using Dijkstra's algorithm. With an intuitive UI, real-time graph visualization, and step-by-step algorithm explanation, RouteOptima demonstrates how advanced graph algorithms can drive efficiency in real-world delivery networks.

## 🚀 Features

- **Graph-Based Delivery Network Modeling:**  
  Visualizes delivery locations (restaurants, kitchens, distribution centers, hubs, customers) as nodes and routes as weighted edges.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm for Path Optimization:**  
  Calculates the shortest/most efficient route between selected source and destination.

- **Interactive Visualization:**  
  - Dynamic SVG-based graph.
  - Animated path highlights and node exploration.
  - Edge weights and node labels.

- **Step-by-Step Algorithm Execution:**  
  - See each step of Dijkstra’s algorithm as it runs.
  - View explored nodes, optimal path sequence, and detailed cost metrics.

- **Responsive & Modern UI:**  
  - Built with Tailwind CSS and Font Awesome.
  - Dark theme, glassmorphism, and smooth transitions.
  - Mobile-friendly navigation and controls.

- **Educational & Practical:**  
  - Suitable for learning about graph algorithms.
  - Can be adapted for real-world logistics optimizations.
